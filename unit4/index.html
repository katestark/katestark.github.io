<h2><div style="line-height:10%"><center>a Craft Beer Caf&eacute;</center></div></h2>
<br>

<p>Think of us as your favorite neighborhood coffee shop, but with beer instead of espresso.<br><br>
Stop in with co-workers to brainstorm over a pint&#8212; because we know that's when the <i>best</i> ideas are born&#8212; catch up with a friend, or snuggle up next to our fireplace with a good book and great brew on one of our comfy couches.
<br><br>
Our name comes from a term for Prohibition, "the Noble Experiment," as coined by President Herbert Hoover in 1928. However, our intentions are a little less pure.
