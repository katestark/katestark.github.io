	<h1>Site Comparison</h1>
	<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p>The <a href="walktofightarthritis.ca">Walk to Fight Arthritis</a> is a site employing the same fundraising platform as we will with the Steady Strides 5k. They target a similar demographic to the Parkinson's Community, and this non-profit is also funded mainly by their walk.<br><br>
		<a href="michaeljfox.org">The Michael J. Fox Foundation (MJFF)</a> raises more money than any other national Parkinson's disease foundation. 
	</p>
	<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size or balance?</h2>
	<p>The Walk to Fight Arthritis uses negative space in the header to draw focus to the event's date, and achieves balance with asymmetry. The text in the Leaderboard is balanced by the larger slider on the right, which is the focal point and contains three calls to action for users.<br><br>
		MJFF is much more symmetrical in its balance on the home page, and does not use much negative space above the fold. Below the fold, negative space is much more widely used with a (mostly) two-column design.
	</p>
	<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<h3>Similarities</h3>
	<p>Both sites employ similar shades of blue, with green accents highlighting where users can donate to the cause. However, both these sites' focal point is a large image with happy people. In one instance, Michael J. Fox, and in the other, people walking in support of the cause. However, the eye only travels to the calls to action after the focal point: a large image with someone you'd want to give money to.<br><br>
		In addition, both sites display their logo in the upper left corner of the page, and donate button in the upper left. The three main calls to action, although the differ in phrasing, are donate, participate, and fundraise.<br><br>
		Both have issues with responsiveness. MJFF uses another landing page for mobile users, so resizing the browser window just reduces the amount of the page that is visible. The Walk for Arthritis header looks weird as the window is collapsed down, and while the footer image is scaled down in a smaller window, its bottom edges are rounded, creating little white triangles within the blue background.</p>
	<h3>Differences</h3>
	<p>MJFF is symetrical, while the Walk for Arthritis is asymetrical.<br><br>The purposes of these sites are also different, and that difference is reflected in the design. The MJFF site seeks to educate users about Parkinson's and the many different ways to get involved, even if they are looking for a donation. The Walk for Arthritis is all about fundraising. There isn't a lot of information on the site about Arthrtis, but links to the Arthritis Foundation's site where further information is available. As a result, the Walk's site can be a lot more streamlined, with clearly prescribed actions defined for the user through size, balance, and flow.
